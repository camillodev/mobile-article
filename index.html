                    <article>
                        <p class="drop-caps">The following is the original piece I wrote for CNN last year about location independent entrepreneurs,
                            also known as “digital nomads.” Since the whole “Work Online, Travel the World and Live the Dream”
                            angle had been done to death in a million places, I decided to go the other direction and show
                            the dark side of being a digital nomad — the challenges one faces, the emotional pitfalls, the
                            social sacrifices.</p>
                        <p>Predictably, CNN hated it. The editors hacked it to pieces and asked me to rewrite sections to make
                            it less gloomy. And since they’re CNN and I’m just an asshole with a book about smut, I said
                            OK.
                        </p>
                        <p>But I was always fond of the original, so I’m posting it here unabridged. Also note: the people and
                            events in the piece are actually composites and mash-ups of my real life experiences and relationships.
                            I did that for the sake of narrative and space. Enjoy.</p>
